# Technical Reference: Preparing Chicken Salad with Leftover Ingredients

## Motivation

This project serves as a practical documentation of a cooking process aimed at efficiently utilizing leftover rotisserie chicken and common kitchen ingredients. The motivation is to reduce food waste and quickly prepare a nutritious meal with minimal additional resources.

## Problem Statement

Leftover food, particularly cooked proteins like rotisserie chicken, often goes unused or is discarded. There is a need for simple, repeatable methods to repurpose these leftovers into appealing meals without requiring extensive culinary expertise or additional shopping.

## Implementation Details

The preparation process is documented in a markdown file (`index.md`), which outlines a sequence of steps starting with auditing available supplies and ending with a mixed chicken salad ready to serve. The instructions are detailed enough to be followed without additional context.

### Ingredient Audit

The documented ingredients include:

- Half a rotisserie chicken
- Greek yogurt (noted preference for Fage 5%)
- Coriander leaves
- Grape tomatoes
- Honey
- Dates

This selection balances protein, herbs, fruits, and a dairy component to create a layered flavor profile.

### Preparation Steps

1. **Cut chicken breast into small chunks:** This provides bite-sized pieces suitable for salad.
2. **Chop coriander leaves finely:** Adds flavor and vitamins.
3. **Mix chicken and herbs:** Initial combination to assess flavor.
4. **Add Greek yogurt:** Introduces creaminess and tang.
5. **Add quartered grape tomatoes:** Adds texture and freshness.
6. **Add chopped dates:** Provides sweetness to complement savory elements.
7. **Add honey sparingly:** Balances tanginess and herbaceous notes.

### Observations

The process is iterative, with tasting after each addition to adjust flavor balance. The use of yogurt as a base allows for a creamy texture without heavy mayonnaise. Dates and honey introduce sweetness that contrasts with the tang of yogurt and the freshness of herbs.

## Practical Considerations

- The recipe is flexible and can be adapted based on available ingredients.
- The documentation style is minimalistic, focusing on practical steps rather than culinary theory.
- Images are included to provide visual reference for the final dish.

## Conclusion

This repository exemplifies a pragmatic approach to food preparation documentation. It emphasizes resourcefulness and simplicity, providing a clear reference for recreating a chicken salad from leftovers. The markdown format ensures easy access and modification for future iterations or related recipes.
